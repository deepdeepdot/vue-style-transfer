## README

This project is based on:
https://github.com/reiinakano/arbitrary-image-stylization-tfjs

I refactored the Javascript and re-implemented the client-side using Vue/Vuetify. There are some upgrades to third party dependencies like Tensorflow.js and some fixes for mobile web camera.

A Vue application can be deployed using [Netlify very quickly](https://medium.com/vuejoy/how-to-deploy-your-vue-app-with-netlify-in-less-than-2-min-d6ab26c6557d)

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) is a [material design](https://material.io/design/) implementation for [Vue](https://vuejs.org)
